Couple","description":"Another Young Couple \u2014 borne out of a camera test for If Beale Street Could Talk, James and I asked my friends Essence and Jihaari, newly transplanted to LA to allow us into their home for an afternoon tea about their lives and loves, apart and together. We were migrating to the Alexa 65 for Beale Street and wanted to see for ourselves how that large-format sensor would affect intimate portraiture within lived spaces\u2026 in particular the faces and spaces of Black folk. <br \/>\n<br \/>\nThese camera tests in real spaces have been a process that have served us well; on The Underground Railroad we didn\u2019t film a young couple but rather our actors, footage that ultimately ended up spread throughout the show. In the similarly named film on this page, A Young Couple, we wanted to test the rig we used on our first feature, Medicine For Melancholy, under ideal conditions for the day if and when we needed to use the set-up for a follow-up feature. By the time Moonlight came around, our budget had grown from from 15k to 1.5 million and the Alexa rendered our Panasonic HVX obsolete. And yet the short lives on, a sister to the one here filmed in 2017 in the run up to the Beale Street shoot. <br \/>\n<br \/>\nIt\u2019s been so long that I\u2019ve lost the actual RAW footage, so what you find here doesn\u2019t contain the full spectrum of what the kit is capable of, but\u2026 it was lovely to see this footage again and reconnect with Essence and J, who\u2019ve only grown in their lives together \u2014 the film is dedicated to their daughter, Ozzie, three now but a soul of the future in the moment\u2019s captured here. <br \/>\n<br \/>\nWatching it, I\u2019m struck by how open and honest Jihaari and Essence are. There\u2019s a way they have with one another that they extend to us, to the watchers and the listeners, the few of us there in the room welcomed into their space. I remember the day vividly and I\u2019m so glad I get to share it with you. <br \/>\n<br \/>\nMuch love to them and you and anybody else out there who needs it. <br \/>\n<br \/>\nAnd, of course, Happy Valentines Day <br \/>\n<br \/>\nBarry","url":"https:\/\/vimeo.com\/798891880","upload_date":"2023-02-14 15:21:56","thumbnail_small":"https:\/\/i.vimeocdn.com\/video\/1610774774-578ef7ee87f49246c97365bfbd1803bd3cf55e93fe1fce1b02ae558b4265f798-d_100x75","thumbnail_medium":"https:\/\/i.vimeocdn.com\/video\/1610774774-578ef7ee87f49246c97365bfbd1803bd3cf55e93fe1fce1b02ae558b4265f798-d_200x150","thumbnail_large":"https:\/\/i.vimeocdn.com\/video\/1610774774-578ef7ee87f49246c97365bfbd1803bd3cf55e93fe1fce1b02ae558b4265f798-d_640","user_id":408920,"user_name":"Barry Jenkins","user_url":"https:\/\/vimeo.com\/barryjenkins","user_portrait_small":"https:\/\/i.vimeocdn.com\/portrait\/1377879_30x30","user_portrait_medium":"https:\/\/i.vimeocdn.com\/portrait\/1377879_75x75","user_portrait_large":"https:\/\/i.vimeocdn.com\/portrait\/1377879_100x100","user_portrait_huge":"https:\/\/i.vimeocdn.com\/portrait\/1377879_300x300","stats_number_of_likes":152,"stats_number_of_plays":8566,"stats_number_of_comments":10,"duration":856,"width":1920,"height":960,"tags":"","embed_privacy":"anywhere"},{"id":797049856,"title":"Apple Music - Stay","description":"","url":"https:\/\/vimeo.com\/797049856","upload_date":"2023-02-08 11:23:58","thumbnail_small":"https:\/\/i.vimeocdn.com\/video\/1606220314-86138a279891d1bdb3fa4900066b269c4b51e0edf5f43f9d7c56af4d49002ddc-d_100x75","thumbnail_medium":"https:\/\/i.vimeocdn.com\/video\/1606220314-86138a279891d1bdb3fa4900066b269c4b51e0edf5f43f9d7c56af4d49002ddc-d_200x150","thumbnail_large":"https:\/\/i.vimeocdn.com\/video\/1606220314-86138a279891d1bdb3fa4900066b269c4b51e0edf5f43f9d7c56af4d49002ddc-d_640","user_id":19337132,"user_name":"Kim Gehrig","user_url":"https:\/\/vimeo.com\/kimgehrig","user_portrait_small":"https:\/\/i.vimeocdn.com\/portrait\/6551592_30x30","user_portrait_medium":"https:\/\/i.vimeocdn.com\/portrait\/6551592_75x75","user_portrait_large":"https:\/\/i.vimeocdn.com\/portrait\/6551592_100x100","user_portrait_huge":"https:\/\/i.vimeocdn.com\/portrait\/6551592_300x300","stats_number_of_likes":285,"stats_number_of_plays":8347,"stats_number_of_comments":11,"duration":118,"width":1920,"height":1080,"tags":"","embed_privacy":"anywhere"},{"id":797853799,"title":"LIKE A GOOD KID","description":"Sara (a 24-year-old girl) is supposed to babysit Matin (a 6-year-old boy) for the day, while his mother is at work.

I really struggled with communicating and getting my ideas out. Sculpture has been really important to that interior self.\u201d Ornate assemblages of salvaged textiles, the works currently in progress are inspired by ceremonial Yoruba masks that are traditionally used in the process of communicating with a spirit or ancestor. This documentary short, shot on 16-millimeter film, evocatively captures the creation of a suite of large-scale masks that radiate their own personalities and desires.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nPatching together the many fabrics collected in her studio, Lewis embraces the histories embedded in the materials she works with.  \"A lot of black creation is an upcycling\" she says, \"regardless of a lack thereof, regardless of an access to. Taking things as they are and letting them shine\". For the artist, the time spent in the studio touching and handling the material is integral to the work, an act of departure into her own interior world. She treats her sculptures as beings in their own right, unrecognized ancestors whose allegorical meaning or talismanic power must be teased out through a hands-on process of recognition. \"I've heard you,\" she offers to the work, \"and these are the symbols I've made in response to you, and you are being seen.\"<br \/>\n<br \/>\nLearn more about the artist at: https:\/\/art21.org\/taulewis<br \/>\n<br \/>\nCREDITS | \"New York Close Up\" Series Producer: Nick Ravich.
